## DevOps
This is the front end static web package for the DevOps project.

### Build
To build / bundle the package run:

`npm run build`

### Dev Server
First, run the development server:

`npm run dev`


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You need to run this along side the dev server for the backend service, instructions can be found here: https://github.com/ConRose456/SE-DevOpsService

Finally you will need to navigate to the GraphQlAPIClient and update the API end point to the localhost domain running the backend service
